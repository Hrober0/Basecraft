# BaseCraft

**BaseCraft** is a sci‑fi strategy and factory‑building game.  
You arrive on a distant planet to mine valuable resources and expand your empire.  
Build complex supply chains, develop production, conquer new territories, strengthen defenses,  
and dominate enemies with a powerful drone network.

## Project Status
This was my **first large Unity project**, so the codebase is challenging to work with  
(reading it may require *steel nerves*).  

Development of BaseCraft is **currently paused** because I’m focusing on creating a **larger RTS game**.  
Still, the game is **fully playable** and offers about **2 hours of gameplay**.

The idea of **connectors instead of grid‑based conveyor belts** was inspired by the mobile game  
[Achikaps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.achikaps).  
However, the connections system wasn’t scalable enough for larger factories,  
and would require some redesign to create a better gameplay experience.

## Contributions Welcome
Although active development is stopped, I’m open to:
- **Bug fixes**
- **Quality of life improvements**
- **Small content additions**
- **Any others ideas or changes**

If you’d like to **use this project** or **create your own game based on it**,  
please send me an email at **bychrober@gmail.com** and share your work — I’d love to see it!
