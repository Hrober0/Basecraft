Tutorial.2_h=Drone station
Tutorial.2_m=This technologically advanced building is ejected from the orbital lander during landing procedure. It stores wares and allows the drones to do work within its range.\n\nIf every single drone stations is destroyed, the colony will not be able to function, so protect them well.
Tutorial.3_h=Actions
Tutorial.3_m=Drones are advanced flying machines that can perform various tasks, such as:\n-dig ores\n-cut and plant trees\n-repair buildings\n-move materials\n\nYou can manage the drone tasks by opening the action menu in the lower right corner and give the appropriate order.\nYou get a few of them when you start a colony, but you can produce more of them as well.
Tutorial.4_h=Building
Tutorial.4_m=Automated buildings are the backbone of our colony.\n\nThey are divided into 4 types: Production, Defence, Energy and  Other.\n\nAll buildings we have plans for can be found in the "Construction" tab in the bottom right corner. You can find there all required materials to build a given object and its description.\n\nAfter selecting the building and the placing it where we want to be, the drones will start carrying the necessary resources from the warehouses.
Tutorial.5_h=Demolition
Tutorial.5_m=You can destroy any building using the options in the delete menu.\n\nYou will find two options there:\nDestruction - Immediate destruction of the building.\nDemolition - The building will be destroyed, but all materials will be recovered
Tutorial.6_h=Research
Tutorial.6_m=As you can see, we’ve got a very poorly database of buildings and recipes. All of the tech plans are owned by BaseCCorp Inc.\n\nYou can get them, by exchanging specific materials.\n\nThe preview of available technologies and their potential cost is located in the “Research” overlap.
Tutorial.7_h=Storage
Tutorial.7_m=All the resources for research have to be transported out to orbital base.\n\nStatus of warehouse of our station can be found in the “Storage” overlap.

<Task texts>
<Tips>
TaskText.T1_h=TIP
TaskText.T1_m=If you want drones to hold a certain amount of items in a building, turn on the "Keep the number of ordered items" option.
TaskText.T1_b=OK
TaskText.T2_h=TIP
TaskText.T2_m=Production buildings can store a certain number of manufactured items. When the space for you those items is full the building stops production. To resume production, items must be transported elsewhere.
TaskText.T2_b=OK
TaskText.T3_h=TIP
TaskText.T3_m=If you don't know how to get or build something, look for it in the Recipes Tab.\nThis tab is located on the left side of the screen.
TaskText.T3_b=OK
TaskText.T4_h=TIP
TaskText.T4_m=You can choose what materials will be stored in the warehouse. To do this, select the warehouse you want to set, then enable the "Show not stored" option to see all available items.\n\nBy clicking on an item in the warehouse, you toggle whether it is accepted by the warehouse not. If the icon for an item is dark, then drones will not voluntarily carry that item to that building.\n\nA slider that you can automatically set to accept or not accept all items is also useful.
TaskText.T4_b=Thanks
TaskText.T5_h=TIP
TaskText.T5_m=Similarly, you can build warehouses for stones and copper. It will certainly speed up the extraction process.
TaskText.T5_b=OK
TaskText.T6_h=TIP
TaskText.T6_m=You can turn connections on/off, destroy them or set their priority by pressing one of the connected buildings and then clicking on an option desired by you and choosing the second building.
TaskText.T6_b=OK
TaskText.T7_h=TIP
TaskText.T7_m=A Connection (conveyor) always transports items from the building that has been chosen as first to the building that has been chosen as second.
TaskText.T7_b=OK
<NoMoreTasks>
TaskText.NoMoreTask_h=Completed all the points from my list!
TaskText.NoMoreTask_m=You've already completed all the points on my list!\nBut don't worry, I got a message that my system will be update soon. With this update, I will receive a new set of quests, new recipes, technologies and much more.
<Page1>
TaskText.P1_1_h=What is going on?
TaskText.P1_1_m=Greetings!\I am Personal Assistant System, P.S.A. for short… My main directive is to assist with your research. You have been awakened because we have reached our destination.\n\nMay I have your permission to scan the planet to find a suitable landing spot?
TaskText.P1_1_b=Scan
TaskText.P1_2_h=What now..?
TaskText.P1_2_m=I found an appropriate spot in the Valley. It will be a great starting point for your future exploration.
TaskText.P1_2_t1=Choose a landing spot in the Valley and start the colonization.
TaskText.P1_3_h=Do you remember everything?
TaskText.P1_3_m=Due to your rapid awakening from a coma, you may experience symptoms of memory loss.\n\nDo you need another training?
TaskText.P1_3_b=Sure
TaskText.P1_3_c=No, thanks
TaskText.P1_4_h=HOT TOPIC
TaskText.P1_4_m=You already know everything you will need.\n\nNow we can start building our colony. First of all, we need to build a smelter. It is necessary to obtain the metals we need. 
TaskText.P1_4_t1=Build a smelter. To do this, open the build menu in the lower right corner, in the Production Tab, select the smelter and build it near the drone station. 
TaskText.P1_5_h=Gather materials and complete the building
TaskText.P1_5_m=You need specific items to create a building. For completion of the smelter 10 units of stone are required, which must be excavated. 
TaskText.P1_5_t1=Dig 10 stones to do this, open the action menu in the lower right corner, and select the mining option. Then click on the nearest Stone Ore as many times as you want. 
TaskText.P1_5_t2=Complete the construction of the smelter. 
TaskText.P1_6_h=Time to make some copper
TaskText.P1_6_m=The smelter will require ingredients to perform its duty, it needs material to smelt and some fuel. At the moment we need to smelt copper, you have to dig it first. 
TaskText.P1_6_t1=Dig 10 copper ore to do this, open the action menu in the lower right corner, and select the mining option. Then click on the nearest copper ore as many times as you want.
TaskText.P1_7_h=WE NEED SOME FUEL
TaskText.P1_7_m=This basic smelter model needs wood as fuel. 
TaskText.P1_7_t1=Get 5 units of wood. To do this, select a Cut tree option from the action menu and cut down some trees.
TaskText.P1_8_h=Transport resources to the smelter
TaskText.P1_8_m=Drones have already transferred the necessary resources to the drone station.\n\nYou can move items to any building. Just click on the building and in the "Order items" field, press the plus symbol, then select what and how many items to deliver. 
TaskText.P1_8_t1=Transport 10 units of copper ore to the smelter. 
TaskText.P1_9_h=WE NEED MORE FUEL
TaskText.P1_9_m=In the same way as the ore, transport the previously harvested tree. 
TaskText.P1_9_t1=Transport 5 units of wood to the smelter. 
TaskText.P1_10_h=Production of copper
TaskText.P1_10_m=You delivered all the materials that were needed to start the smelter. Now you have to choose the option of smelting copper in the smelter.\n\nKeep that in mind- If the smelter runs out of material to smelt or fuel to burn,  these resources must be harvested and delivered.
TaskText.P1_10_t1=Select the copper production option and smelt 3 units of copper. 
TaskText.P1_11_h=The Next  Step - Crafter
TaskText.P1_11_m=Crafter is the last of the most necessary buildings in this phase of development. It will allow you to combine and process materials into more advanced ones.\n\nTo build it, we need copper, wood, and stone bricks. Stone bricks are made of molten stone. Go Dig some stone and deliver it to the smelter. 
TaskText.P1_11_t1=Dig next 10 units of stone.
TaskText.P1_12_h=Need of the brick
TaskText.P1_12_m=Now all you have to do is move the dug stone into the smelter.\n\nTo smelt stone bricks, change the currently produced material in the smelter, to do this, click on the recipe change arrow in the smelter menu and select the production of stone bricks.\n\nDo not forget about stone and wood that have to be delivered to the smelter, and if there are not enough of them, you have to fill them up. 
TaskText.P1_12_t1=Make 5 units of stone bricks.
TaskText.P1_13_h=To craft or not to craft…
TaskText.P1_13_m=So we have all the ingredients we need. As I mentioned, the crafter allows us to produce more interesting materials, thanks to which you will be able to automate some mundane activities.
TaskText.P1_13_t1=Build a crafter near the smelter and drone station. It can be found in the Build menu on the Production page. 
<Page2>
TaskText.P2_1_h=Wood for the Crafter
TaskText.P2_1_m=Crafter needs power!\n\nIts basic version - the stove runs on fuel. Get him some wood.
TaskText.P2_1_t1=Transport 5 units of wood to the crafter. 
TaskText.P2_2_h=Production of planks
TaskText.P2_2_m=Now that we have power, it's time to start production.\n\nAt this moment, you need planks the most, produce several of them.
TaskText.P2_2_t1=Produce 2 planks, select the plank production option in the crafter.
TaskText.P2_3_h=There’s always room for an upgrade.
TaskText.P2_3_m=The biggest problem with the amount of wood is that it is still missing.\n\nAs you may have noticed, the drones take quite the time to transport the wood.\n\nYou should shorten this path to a minimum, to do this build a warehouse near trees.
TaskText.P2_3_t1=Build a warehouse. To do this, open the construction menu in the lower right corner, in the "Other" tab, select a warehouse and build it not far from the tree station.
TaskText.P2_4_h=First automation
TaskText.P2_4_m=Connections are the most important part of our transporting system as they automatically transfer items between buildings. Conveyors can transfer items only in one direction from building  A to building B. Build a conveyor that can send the wood from the warehouse to the smelter, you can also connect the crafter identically.\n\nThey can only be placed in a straight line, which cannot be built on other buildings. If you cannot connect the buildings, destroy them and place the building in a different location.
TaskText.P2_4_t1=Build a conveyor between the warehouse and the smelter. To do that, click on the button “connect” in right low corner. Then select “basic conveyor”. Press at the warehouse, next press at the smelter.
TaskText.P2_5_h=Wooden craving
TaskText.P2_5_m=How much wood is enough wood, Right?\n\nThe answer is simple – a lot…\n\nMake sure to set magazine to accept only the wood, I wrote about it before, if you haven't listened then look for it yourself in the magazine options. 
TaskText.P2_5_t1=Store 10 units of wood in storage. 
TaskText.P2_6_h=Trees are missing now
TaskText.P2_6_m=You’ve sure cut a lot of trees. It’s high time you planted some as well.
TaskText.P2_6_t1=Plant 5 trees. To do so, pick a grassy terrain and click on the button showcasing a sapling. A drone will be launched to plant the sapling, which will shortly become a fully grown tree.
